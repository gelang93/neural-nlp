# nlp-neural
Framework for performing NLP deep learning experiments.

The master branch for this repo contains some basic infrastructure code I found myself copying from repo to repo every time I wanted to start some new deep learning experiments. Instead of continuing that workflow, my plan is to branch from this code whenever I want to do some new experiments. So be sure to check out the branches for different experiments!

This repo makes heavy uses of the [keras](http://keras.io) and [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) libraries. Thanks to the authors of those libraries for making my life much easier! :)
